Some ideas to be discussed with Adriano and Aninnha

1. Organizing the projects into areas and not the names of the participants. I personally think it is more elegant.

1.1. In this way, it is supposed to have one folder for each participant (for instance, Alex, Chen, Geanderson, etc)

1.2. Let the partipants create a branch and add the new content to that branch as they need

2. Inside the folders, I really think a notebook is by far the most elegant way to show the content to our clients

2.1. I have chechek the MarkDown style that, for instance, Tiago uses, but I think notebooks are easier to use and handle in the future

2.2. Alongside that, there is a very elegant way to handle notebook using the following website created by the Jupyter team (http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
